Happy coding! üéâ

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Database design:

-- Table for storing job listings

CREATE TABLE jobs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(100),
  location VARCHAR(100),
  salary_range VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table for storing job applications

CREATE TABLE applications (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  resume_link TEXT,
  cover_letter TEXT,
  job_id INTEGER REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Backend architecture:

Server actions for - creatingNew job, applying job.
api routes - updateJob, deleteJob 
db actions - getJobs, getJobById, createApplication, getApplicationsByJobId, createJob

Frontend implementation:

actions - have db action code
components - have ui and project related components
other folders follow typical app router structure

Challenges faced:

1. Faced issue with params handling both in client and server components:

Solved them by reading the doc: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis

2. Redirect err cathcing issue:

Solved them by reading doc: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#redirect-function

3. Wanted to add some good notification, so converted some
components from server to client based components

Had issues changing from async to sync, adding directives
and some others - nextjs logs helped here

4. Type check issue for nextjs type system

Solved it adding updated expected types:

<!-- API Routes: Use context: { params: Promise<{ id: string > } and await context.params. -->

This was very strange as in locally running fine, but when
i try to build. Issue araised.
It was something like at runtime it resolves automatically to value, but type check time is is expected to be promise

5. Had issue reflecting the uptodate data in UI for both new job / delete job in production.
Similarly it was working fine locally, but not in production.

Solved it by reading / getting to know that nextjs by default heavily caches server components for optimization. so, i used revalidatePath()
and also added router refresh as well.

## Getting Started useful links for nextjs

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
